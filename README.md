We conducted a phylogenetic analysis to confirm previous phylogenetic reportings in the literature. Using 104 amino acid sequences isolated globally and from insect, animal, and human vectors, we will construct a phylogenetic tree for each of the three structural proteins (E, C, pM) grouped by geographical region.
